Air traffic control (ATC) is a service to prevent collisions of planes during take-off or land- ing. ATC provides information for pilots during landing or take-off. In this project, you will implement a simulator that simulates multiple independently acting planes in air traffic by modelling their take-off and landing, where the air traffic is controlled by the ATC tower. Your job is to implement the collision and deadlock-free simulator.

Running Simulation:

p: probablity of landing or departing

s: simulation time

n: every nth seconds log all planes in the simulation.

./run -p 0.5 -s 60 -n 20
